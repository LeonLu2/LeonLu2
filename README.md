# 👋 Hi there!


I'm Leon, a dedicated software engineer and a Master's student in Computer Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University. With a rich background in various programming languages and frameworks, I'm passionate about developing innovative software solutions.

# 👨‍💻 Experience

For the past summer, I've honed my skills as a Software Engineer Intern at Whole in One Health. Here, I took the initiative to construct the company's first-ever blog page and online store, and I spearheaded the integration of cloud-based solutions, enhancing the digital capabilities of this health-oriented firm. As a deeply committed full-stack engineer, I seamlessly blend technical prowess with creativity, consistently aiming to deliver software solutions that not only meet but also exceed client and end-user expectations. Every project I undertake is approached with a detail-oriented mindset, where I continuously aim to optimize code, enrich the user experience, and stay aligned with the latest industry trends and standards. 

My experience across Frontend, Backend, and Cloud Services has granted me an adaptive problem-solving aptitude, and I'm well-versed in utilizing tools and technologies like Java, Spring Boot, React, along with various databases, middlewares, and cloud services. This broad spectrum of expertise provides me with a holistic view of the software development lifecycle. But beyond the code and tech, I deeply value and prioritize effective communication, always emphasizing the importance of collaboration with cross-functional teams in my projects.

# 🌍 Hobbies & Interests

- **📸 Photography** - Armed with my Canon 5D Mark IV and DJI Mini 2, I capture the beautiful moments that life and my travels offer. Every shot tells a story, and I enjoy sharing these narratives on my social media, spreading the joy with friends and fellow enthusiasts.

- **🚙 Traveling** - I'm an adventurer at heart, constantly seeking new experiences and exploring different corners of the world. The thrill of discovering diverse cultures and meeting people from all walks of life is what drives my passion for travel. Over the past decades, I've had the privilege of exploring countries like China, the US, Australia, and New Zealand. Within the US, I've ventured through 32 different states and developed a deep appreciation for the stunning national parks that grace this country.

- **🍲 Cooking** - When I'm not coding, you can often find me in the kitchen, experimenting with a wide range of Chinese recipes that I've learned online and from friends. Cooking is not just a hobby; it's a way for me to express my creativity and share memorable moments with my friends and family through the joy of food.
